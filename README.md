# README for CM24681: Fuzzy Logic and Movement Systems

## Project Overview

This project, titled **Fuzzy Logic and Movement Systems**, demonstrates the implementation of various systems and algorithms for movement control and obstacle handling using Python. It includes tasks such as PID control, right-edge detection, and obstacle avoidance, alongside a combined approach integrating these functionalities.

## Important Note

**These scripts are intended to be executed only after SSHing into the robot's system.** Ensure that you are connected to the robot via SSH and have the necessary permissions to run these scripts.

## Key Features

1. **PID Control**:
   - Implements Proportional, Integral, and Derivative control logic.
   - Script: `Tasks/1. PID/main.py`

2. **Right Edge Detection**:
   - Detects the right edge of a path using sensor data.
   - Script: `Tasks/2. Right Edge Detection/main.py`
   - Input/Output: `right_edge.csv`, `right_edge.json`

3. **Obstacle Avoidance**:
   - Identifies and avoids obstacles in the path.
   - Script: `Tasks/3. Obstacle Avoidance/main.py`
   - Input/Output: `object_avoidance.csv`, `object_avoidance.json`

4. **Combination Task**:
   - Integrates PID control, edge detection, and obstacle avoidance into a cohesive system.
   - Script: `Tasks/4. Combination/main.py`

5. **Fuzzy Logic System**:
   - Utilizes fuzzy logic to make decisions based on input conditions.
   - Script: `Movement/FuzzyLogicSystem.py`

## Installation and Setup

1. **SSH into the Robot**:
   - Use SSH to connect to the robot's system:
     ```bash
     ssh user@robot-ip-address
     ```

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Clone the repository onto the robot:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository-url>
     cd CM24681_Thabang_Maribana_CE801
     ```

3. **Prepare the Environment**:
   - Run the `prep.py` script to install dependencies and configure the environment:
     ```bash
     python prep.py
     ```

4. **Run the System**:
   - Use the `run.py` script as the main entry point:
     ```bash
     python run.py
     ```

## Usage

- Modify the configuration files (`right_edge.json`, `object_avoidance.json`) to tailor the system to your requirements.
- Scripts in the `Tasks` folder can be executed individually for specific tasks or combined using the `run.py` script.

## Dependencies

The necessary dependencies will be automatically installed when running `prep.py`.

## Notes

- For detailed documentation, refer to the `Readme` file under the `Movement` directory.
- Sample data files (`.csv` and `.json`) are provided for testing and demonstration purposes.
